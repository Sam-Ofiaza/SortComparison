Project was imported and originally made for CS 3345 (Data Structures and Introduction to Algorithmic Analysis) with Professor Kamran Khan.
The documentation has more details about everything I did here.

Thoughts: The main difficulty here was data management. Six different sorts, each having a time and count for movements and comparisons, as well as all sorts being tested against
four different list types made it difficult to store all that data. I settled with a static two-dimensional array of longs, though if more sorts were added, some code would have
to be modified. An ArrayList of ArrayLists would probably be more adaptable. The data for percent difference wasn't hard to calculate, just hard to keep track of along with
everything else. One major limitation in my code is how each sort's class must be instantiated as a polymorphic object with an abstract Sorter class. I couldn't find a way
to just call each sort without needing to actually name each one. Maybe I could have an ArrayList storing an object of each sort and go through that instead of individually
listing each sort. I also included a crude GUI using Java Swing that I learned and made in one day for last-minute extra credit, though code for simply printing the data to
standard output is still there, just commented out.
